# Professional Golf Database
Documentation for a professional golf database.

In order to receive the most accurate tournament predictions, it is important to create data sets with as much information as possible. The more variables to test with the model, the greater the likelihood of an accurate prediction. Six web scraping programs have been created in order to acquire professional golf data. The six programs acquire the following data, PGA Tour Statistics, PGA Tour Scorecard data, PGA Tour Course History, PGA Tour Tournament History, Official World Golf Ranking (OWGR) data and LPGA Tour Statistics. The programming language Python was used to create the web-scraping programs. A few of the main libraries used to acquire, manipulate and analyze the data include, BeautifulSoup, Selenium, Pandas, NumPy, and many others.
